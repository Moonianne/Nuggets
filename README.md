# Nuggets

Earlier this year I learned that my dog (my Nugget!) has IVDD. (Intervertabral Disc Disease). A big part of his recovery was managing his weight and when your dog is restricted to crate rest the only you can do is cut his caloric intake. 

That's where this dumb little project of mine comes in. It started as a a quick thing my partner wrote in MatLab that we thought would better serve us on our mobile phones. At the moment this is only designed to work with the menu available to my dog but I am hoping to slowly expand it to allow for different dog profiles, with a large selection of foods that are available.

This project is both a way to give my partner and I an easy way to determine how much our dog can eat of his favorite foods and a change for me to experiment with new tools that have come onto the scene for Android Development.



More Info to Come! Thanks for stopping by :)
